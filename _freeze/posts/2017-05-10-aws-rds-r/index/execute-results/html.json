Note that you should get the most recent github version of `dplyr`, along with the database specific pieces from `dbplyr`.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(DBI)\n# library(RMySQL)\n\nlibrary(tidyquant)\n\n# devtools::install_github(\"tidyverse/dplyr\")\n# devtools::install_github(\"tidyverse/dbplyr\")\nlibrary(dplyr)\n# library(dbplyr)\n```\n:::\n\nGetting connected isn't too hard once you know what you're looking for.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncn <- dbConnect(drv      = RMySQL::MySQL(), \n                username = \"user1\", \n                password = \"testpassword\", \n                host     = \"davisdbinstance.crarljboc8to.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com\", \n                port     = 3306, \n                dbname   = \"firstdb\")\n```\n:::\n\nLet's go through the arguments to `dbConnect()`, the function from `DBI` that we used to connect.\n\n-   `drv` - The driver I used is from the `RMySQL` package, an implementation of the general interface provided by `DBI`.\n    I'll leave it to [the experts](https://github.com/rstats-db/DBI) to explain all of this.\n\n-   `username` / `password` - You'll have to have created a user and password on AWS first, but then you can use them here.\n\n-   `host` The host name is the Endpoint of your RDS server, without the port on the end.\n    I've attached a screenshot to show where to find this.\n    Basically, on the RDS Dashboard Instances page, hit the drop down arrow beside \"MySQL\" to show the Endpoint.\n\n![](./img/2017-05-10-aws-dashboard.png)\n\n-   `port` - The rest of the Endpoint shows the port that you'll need to access your RDS instance through.\n    That goes here.\n\n-   `dbname` - Finally, you'll need the DB Name you used when setting up the instance.\n    This can be found by clicking Instance Actions -\\> See Details, and then under Configuration Details you'll find DB Name.\n\n### Step 2: The one where you take it for a test spin\n\nWell, alright...that was...cool?\nHow do we know it's working?\nLet's get some data to load into the database.\nWe will use some Apple stock data retrieved through `tidyquant`.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\naapl <- tq_get(\"AAPL\")\n\nslice(aapl, 1:10)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\nTo write the tibble (data frame) to the database, we will use another function called `dbWriteTable()`.\nIt's pretty straightforward.\n\"name\" is the name of the table you are creating, and \"value\" is the data frame you want to write.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndbWriteTable(cn, name = \"apple\", value = aapl)\n```\n:::\n\nNow the fun part!\nLet's use a SQL query to pull it back down with `dbGetQuery()`.\nThis function is a combination of `dbSendQuery()`, which returns a result set for your query, and `dbFetch()` which returns the rows from that result set.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\napple_from_db <- dbGetQuery(cn, \"SELECT * FROM apple;\")\n\n# This effectively is the same as\n# dbReadTable(cn, \"apple\")\n\nslice(apple_from_db, 1:10)\n```\n:::\n\nThere are a huge number of functions from `DBI` that you can use to communicate with databases.\nMaybe I will cover more in a separate post, but for now, let's move on to `dplyr`.\n\n### Step 3: The one with the pliers\n\nBefore `dplyr` 0.6.0 was announced, you'd have to disconnect, and then reconnect through a `dplyr` specific function, `src_mysql()`.\nThat would look something like the code below.\nSince then, however, you can now use the `DBI` connection with `dplyr`!\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# There is no need for this code anymore!\ndbDisconnect(cn)\n\ncn <- src_mysql(user     = \"user1\",\n                password = \"testpassword\",\n                host     = \"davisdbinstance.crarljboc8to.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com\",\n                port     = 3306,\n                dbname   = \"firstdb\")\n```\n:::\n\nSelect the apple table from the database.\n*This does not actually pull the data into memory*.\nIt just makes a connection!\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# With dplyr 0.6.0 we can just use the DBI connection!\napple_table <- tbl(cn, \"apple\")\n\n# By default the first 1000 rows are displayed\napple_table\n```\n:::\n\nThe best part is that we can use almost any dplyr command with this!\nIt queries the database, and does not do the manipulation in R.\nAll of the familiar syntax of dplyr, but with databases.\nLet's use `filter()` to get all of the rows after January 1, 2009.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfilter(apple_table, date > \"2009-01-01\")\n```\n:::\n\nTo do any serious manipulation outside of `dplyr`, you'll likely have pull the data into memory to be able to use it with other R functions.\nHere, I'll use the `dplyr` equivalent to `dbWriteTable()` to add the stock prices for IBM to the database.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nibm <- tq_get(\"IBM\")\n\ncopy_to(cn, df = ibm, temporary = FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\nTo actually retrieve the data to memory, first make the connection using `tbl()` like before, and then use `collect()` to create the in memory tibble.\nUnfortunately, dates are stored as characters in the table, and `collect()` won't try to fix that, so I'll also take advantage of the `readr` package's `type_convert()` function to do the thinking for me.\n\nOnce we have the data in memory, we can calculate the daily return with `tidyquant` and `tq_mutate()`.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Connection\nibm_table <- tbl(cn, \"ibm\")\n\n# Collect to tibble\nreal_tibble <- collect(ibm_table) %>%\n  readr::type_convert()\n\n# Daily return\nreal_tibble <- real_tibble %>% \n  tq_mutate(select     = adjusted, \n            mutate_fun = periodReturn, \n            period     = \"daily\")\n\nreal_tibble\n```\n:::\n\nAlways disconnect when you're finished!\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndbDisconnect(cn)\n```\n:::\n\n### Last words\n\nHopefully I've been able to show you the power of `DBI` + `dplyr` with Amazon RDS. This integration has come a long way, and is just one of the huge advancements that the RStudio team has been working on in collaboration with other R users in the community.\n\nUntil next time!",
